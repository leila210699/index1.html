  <div class="block1">Despite the fact that every time life tries to prove me wrong, I continue to believe that good must defeat the evil that the world still exists sincere friendship, not the pursuit of connections and benefits, real love, and not the calculation... I continue to believe in miracles, and most importantly, that each of us is able at least once to work a small miracle..
